# FileChooserForAndroid
a simple java class for choosing file in your Android smartphone.
The MainActivity is an example and you can know how to use this class in it :).
This class is inherited from Activity.So don't forget to add it in your Manifest file.
The permission of "READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" is needed to be added into your Manifest file,too.If it fails to get the permission,it will always return a string of "null".
activity_file_chooser.xml and details_textview.xml is needed.
